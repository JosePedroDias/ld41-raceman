# LD41 - Raceman

A Ludum Dare Jam entry

[Game page on LDJam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/raceman).

Play it here [HERE](https://josepedrodias.github.io/ld41-raceman/dist/)!

Use the arrow keys to move your car. Pick every dot while avoiding the enemy cars.


## Concept

Pacman meets racing game.
Based on the pacman level ideas - a maze, a finite set of items to pick to complete the level,
simple navigation for the ghosts, special items to pick up.
The twist - you drive a race car. Ghosts may do too Possibly nitros to pick up...

...they ended up being the final graphics due to time constraints so I opted out of this category :/
