# LD41 - Raceman

A Ludum Dare Compo entry, hopefully...

Try it out [HERE](https://josepedrodias.github.io/ld41-raceman/dist/)!


## Concept

Pacman meets racing game.
Based on the pacman level ideas - a maze, a finite set of items to pick to complete the level,
simple navigation for the ghosts, special items to pick up.
The twist - you drive a race car. Ghosts may do too Possibly nitros to pick up...
