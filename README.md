# LD41 - Raceman

A Ludum Dare Compo entry, hopefully...


## Concept

Pacman meets racing game.
Based on the pacman level ideas - a maze, a finite set of items to pick to complete the level,
simple navigation for the ghosts, special items to pick up.
The twist - you drive a race car. Ghosts may do too (?)
There may be nitros too (?)


## Not yet clear

* the visuals - raw top-down 2d shapes? 2d texture sprites?
* the simulation - simple collision detection or physics with inertia?
* dumb or no sfx vs engine sounds with sound APIs?


## TODO

* basic level elements:
  * hero
  * walls
  * dot item (score increase. when all picked, complete level)
  * fat dot item (enemies vulnerable for x secs)
  * baddies (pursuit and evade)
  * pickups (nitros?)
* game loop setup
* scripted patrolling movement
* basic enemy movement (replicate pacman or not?)
* score and level completeness
* sfx
* artwork
* menus
