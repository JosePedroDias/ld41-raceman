# LD41 - Raceman

A Ludum Dare Compo entry, hopefully...

Try it out [HERE](https://josepedrodias.github.io/ld41-raceman/dist/)!


## Concept

Pacman meets racing game.
Based on the pacman level ideas - a maze, a finite set of items to pick to complete the level,
simple navigation for the ghosts, special items to pick up.
The twist - you drive a race car. Ghosts may do too (?)
There may be nitros too (?)



## TODO

* ➡️ game loop setup (rendering, physics)

* keyboard handling

* basic level elements:
  * hero
  * walls
  * dot item (score increase. when all picked, complete level)
  * fat dot item (enemies vulnerable for x secs)
  * baddies (pursuit and evade)
  * pickups (nitros?)

* scripted patrolling movement
* basic enemy movement (replicate pacman or not?)
* score and level completeness
* artwork
  * [normal lighting](http://pixijs.io/examples/#/layers/normals.js)

* menus
